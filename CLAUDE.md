# CLAUDE.md – Winter War: Summa

Notes for Claude (and any other AI assistant) working on this project. Read this first.

## The project
- First-person shooter, Winter War 1939–40, Battle of Summa (Mannerheim Line). Player is a
  Finnish soldier defending a trench against Soviet attacks across open frozen ground.
- Godot **4.7.2**, **GDScript only** (no C#), **Compatibility renderer** (must export to web/HTML5).
- Physics: Jolt. Window 1280×720, stretch aspect "expand".
- Long-term goals: real elevation data for terrain (Copernicus GLO-30 DEM; Summa is in today's
  Russia so Finnish NLS data does not cover it), peer-to-peer co-op (WebRTC) for 2–4 players.

## Working with the owner
- Total beginner with coding and with Godot: explain important concepts briefly, in plain words.
- Before writing code for a milestone: show a short plan + node tree and **wait for approval**.
- Work in milestones; stop after each so he can test in Godot. Give exact test steps.
- After each milestone: make a git commit with a clear message. He pushes with GitHub Desktop
  ("Push origin"). Check `git status` before writing files – never overwrite his own edits.
- If something can't be done well in the web export, say so and suggest an alternative.

## Milestones
- [x] M1 project setup, input map, test level, player movement
- [x] M2 weapons and shooting
- [x] M3 enemy AI (state machine) and wave spawner
- [x] M4 HUD, death/respawn (5 s), main menu (Single Player; greyed-out Host/Join Co-op), pause menu
- [x] M5 web export test and performance check (Settings menu, benchmark, baked CSG)
- [x] P1 graphics: clear freezing day (sky shader, snow shader, log walls, spruce LOD forest, tree line)
- [x] W1 weapons: imported Mosin/Suomi view models, Maxim M/09-21 mounted in the bunker (F),
  CREDITS.md + Credits menu. Lahti-Saloranta left out (no usable model; the owner's choice) –
  weapon slot 3 is free for it.
- [x] P2 effects, sound, soldiers (skinned code-built soldier, code animation, sprays/smoke/breath/
  drift, audio buses, ambience, footsteps, bullet cracks, damage indicator, hit flinch).
- Next: the owner picks from "Development ideas" below.

## Development ideas (after P2, not yet approved)
1. Maxim polish (owner: "needs to be improved"): proper aiming through its sights, belt feed
   animation (the glTF has one), steam from the water jacket in long bursts, overheating,
   gunner's hands on the grips, better sound.
2. Hands and arms in first person (guns float now); Finnish white snow-camo sleeves/mittens.
3. Real Summa terrain from the owner's maps + Copernicus DEM; real trench line, the big concrete
   bunkers (e.g. Sj5 "Millionaire"), anti-tank rocks, barbed wire, shell craters.
4. Soviet attack variety: tanks (T-26/T-28) with infantry behind them, artillery barrages
   (craters, camera shake), enemies using cover, grenades, smoke screens, officers.
5. Player options: Molotov cocktails / satchel charges against tanks, grenades, bandages,
   ammo crate in the trench, a firing step, prone, leaning.
6. Game structure: hold for N waves → victory/defeat screen, difficulty levels, short winter day
   turning to dusk/night with flares, scores.
7. Finnish comrades: AI riflemen in the trench (later replaced by co-op players).
8. Co-op over WebRTC (needs a small signaling server) with a lobby code.
9. Real sound recordings (CC0) to replace the generated ones; shouts; menu music.
10. Options: field of view, key rebinding, gamepad; itch.io release page.
11. Lahti-Saloranta (slot 3) if a usable model turns up, or built from shapes.

## Multiplayer-ready architecture (mandatory)
- Single player = host with no clients (OfflineMultiplayerPeer, peer id 1). Code everything
  through the high-level multiplayer API; check `multiplayer.is_server()` for authority.
- Host is authority for enemy AI, hit detection, damage, deaths, spawning, game state.
- Player nodes are named after their peer id. `PlayerInput` (authority = owning peer) reads
  devices; `Player` only reads `PlayerInput`. One-shot actions are RPCs to peer 1
  (`request_jump/reload/switch/god_mode`), consumed on the host (`consume_*`).
- Shooting: owner's `WeaponController` decides trigger timing + plays effects locally, then
  `server_fire.rpc_id(1, origin, dir)`; host validates (ammo, fire rate, origin), raycasts,
  calls `take_damage()`, broadcasts `show_impact`, sends `confirm_hit` to the shooter.
- Spawning via `MultiplayerSpawner` (players → `Players`, enemies → `Enemies`); synced state via
  `MultiplayerSynchronizer` (InputSync, StateSync, WeaponSync, WaveSync, DummySync).
- No "the player" singleton: use the `players` group. Autoloads: `NetworkManager` (connection)
  and `Settings` (user preferences + quality presets; signal `changed`). Neither holds game state.
- Death: host sets `Player.is_dead` (synced), emits `died`; `Game` respawns after `respawn_time`
  via `Player.respawn()`, which tells the owner's PlayerInput the new view with `set_look` RPC.
- UI only reads state: `HUD` finds the local player and listens to signals. Pause menu (Esc)
  pauses only in single player (`NetworkManager.is_single_player()`), and opens itself whenever
  the mouse is not captured (browser pointer lock needs a click).

## Conventions
- Folders: `scenes/`, `scripts/` (player, weapons, enemies, world, game), `resources/`
  (materials, weapons, enemies), `levels/`, `ui/`, `autoload/`, `assets/`, `tools/` (helpers,
  ignored by Godot via `.gdignore`).
- Static typing everywhere, `@export` for tunables (with `##` doc comments), signals between
  systems, short commented scripts. Input actions live in Project Settings (physical keys).
- Data-driven: `WeaponData` (`resources/weapons/*.tres`), `EnemyData` (`resources/enemies/*.tres`).
- Damage interface: `take_damage(amount: float, attacker_id: int, hit_position: Vector3,
  hit_normal: Vector3) -> bool` (returns true if the hit killed). Enemies use attacker_id -1.
- Groups: `game`, `players`, `enemies`, `terrain`, `impact_effects`, `wave_spawner`, `player_spawn`,
  `enemy_spawn`, `attack_point`, `deep_snow`, `navigation_source`.
- Physics layers: 1 world, 2 players, 3 enemies, 4 triggers.
- Surface metadata `surface` = `snow` (default) / `wood` / `earthwork` / `cloth`; meta
  `attach_holes` makes bullet holes stick to moving targets.
- Hearing: `get_tree().call_group("enemies", "hear_noise", source, interest, radius)`.
- Map: 300 × 300 m, origin in the centre. Finnish trench at z ≈ 52–70 (floor y = -1.4,
  ground y = 0); enemies come from the south forest (z ≈ -118) towards +z. Forward is -z.

## Web export limits (Compatibility renderer) – decisions already made
- No volumetric fog → depth + height fog. No Decal node → pooled quads (`ImpactEffects`).
- Crouch is **C** (Ctrl also bound, but Ctrl+W closes browser tabs).
- Snow = CPUParticles3D following the local player only. Trees = MultiMesh chunks with
  visibility ranges. One shadowed sun, short shadow distance. Only the local muzzle flash has
  a light. Export without threads. Navigation mesh is pre-baked (no runtime baking).
- CSG trench/bunker should be converted to static meshes before the web export (M5).
- Max 16 enemies alive; enemy senses run ~5×/s; no RVO avoidance.

## Graphics settings & web build
- Quality presets live in `autoload/settings.gd` (`PRESETS`); `scripts/game/quality_applier.gd`
  applies them (groups `sun`, `forest`, `world_environment`, players' snow).
- Tonemapper is **Linear** on purpose: in Compatibility, Filmic looks different when
  `scaling_3d_scale` < 1, so presets would change the colours.
- `display/window/stretch/mode = canvas_items` so UI scales with the browser window.
- Terrain mesh does not cast shadows (it doubled the triangle count for nothing).
- Web export preset "Web" (no threads) → `export/web/` (git-ignored). Export from the command
  line: `godot --headless --path . --export-release "Web" export/web/index.html` (needs the
  4.7.2 export templates). `python3 tools/web_smoke_test.py` checks it in headless Chromium.
- Measured budget (High, after P1): ~190 draw calls (260 max), ~255k triangles/frame, CPU scripts
  1–2 ms + physics 2.5–4 ms with 16 enemies (native). Keep new art within the README's budget table.

## Graphics (P1) – how it is built
- Look: stylized-realistic, clear freezing day, low warm sun in the SSW (in front-left of the
  trench), blue sky ambient → blue shadows. Linear tonemap, exposure 0.85, sun energy 1.25.
- Shaders in `resources/shaders/`; materials (`resources/materials/*.tres`) are written by
  `build_scenes.gd` (`_shader_mat`). Textures in `assets/textures/` come from
  `tools/make_textures.py` (FFT noise → tileable). Import settings: VRAM compressed + mipmaps
  (`snow_mask.png` lossless: it holds data, sparkle dots), normal-map detection disabled –
  shaders decode normals themselves (`xy * 2 - 1`).
- Snow/log shaders map textures by **world position** (CSG UVs are stretched).
- Terrain vertex colour for the snow shader: R < 1 = ice (bog), G < 1 = trampled snow
  (trench floor). Meshes without vertex colours read as white = plain snow.
- Forest LOD is decided **per tree in the spruce shader** (dithered cross-fade over
  `fade_band` m), not per chunk – whole 50 m chunks switching at once looked like random
  popping. `ForestScatter._process` passes the camera position (`lod_camera`) to its own copies
  of the tree materials (near = `lod_mode` 0, far = 1); shadow pass can't use the shader's camera.
  Chunk visibility ranges are only coarse culling, widened by the chunk radius.
  Per chunk: `Near0_*`/`Near1_*` (detailed; neighbouring chunks alternate the two shapes, one
  draw call each), `Shadow_*` (simple tree, shadows only, near range), `Far_*` (simple tree, no
  shadows – sun shadows end before it starts). `TreeLine` ring (radius 330/520 m).
  Trunk material is the same shader with `trunk = true` (bark texture).
  Per-tree values go in the MultiMesh **instance colour** (B = snow, A = tint); spruce vertex
  colour R = can hold snow, G = AO, B/A = 1; UV.x = 0 at trunk … 1 at branch tips.
  Tree *look* uses its own RNG so positions (and the baked navmesh) stay unchanged.
- Quality presets also set `tree_detail_distance` (35/50/70 m).
- Benchmark turns V-Sync off on desktop (else FPS is capped at the monitor rate). Godot's
  TIME_PROCESS includes CPU-side rendering, so the benchmark shows physics time only.

## Weapons (W1) – how it is built
- Downloads (Sketchfab glTF zips) stay in `assets_source/` (git-ignored); `tools/import_weapons.py`
  writes `assets/models/weapons/<name>/model.gltf` + textures shrunk to ≤1024 px.
  All three models are CC-BY 4.0 → `CREDITS.md` (shown in the main menu via the builder).
- View models: `_place_gun_mesh()` in the builder puts the glTF under `Model/Mesh`, turned and
  scaled so the model's rear sight lands on `AimPoint` (Mosin model points +z → yaw PI, scale
  0.774; Suomi is in cm → 0.0094). `ViewModel` gathers `bolt_part_names` into a Bolt node and
  hides `hidden_part_names` at runtime (names from the glTF). Per-gun `hip_offset`.
- Maxim = `MountedGun` (StaticBody3D, group `mounted_guns`): host owns `user_id`, `ammo`,
  `is_reloading` (GunSync). `Player.mounted_gun_path` (StateSync) links player → gun; host
  pins the player to `SeatPoint` and handles F (`request_interact`/`consume_interact`).
  `WeaponController` routes trigger/ammo/reload to the gun while mounted; the host's bullet
  logic is shared: `WeaponController.resolve_shot()`. `PlayerInput.add_look()` clamps the view
  with `MountedGun.clamp_look()` (left/right traverse separate). Turning model parts are
  reparented under `Pivot` at runtime (`turning_part_names`); the glTF animation is unused.
- Maxim placement: barrel at y 0.2 in the 0.5 m firing slit (y 0.1–0.6, made taller in W1),
  gun at x = -1.0 so the bunker entrance stays free (test_m1 crouch test). Limits 14° L / 40° R,
  -7°…+4°: `test_w1.gd` checks every allowed aim fits through the slit.

## Effects, sound, soldiers (P2) – how it is built
- Soldier = `SoldierVisual` (Enemy's `Visual`): builds a Skeleton3D (12 bones, `SoldierMesh.Bone`)
  and one shared skinned ArrayMesh (`SoldierMesh.get_mesh()`, ~780 tris, vertex colours; alpha =
  cloth type for `soldier.gdshader`). Poses are set in code every frame from synced state
  (position delta → walk speed, `state`, `is_kneeling`); arms use 2-bone IK to grip the rifle.
  Muzzle = BoneAttachment3D on the rifle bone (`visual.muzzle`; it lags the bone by one frame).
  Per-soldier material copy (coat tint) and size. Death fall direction comes from `hash(name)`
  so all computers agree. Enemy RPCs: `show_shot_effects`, `show_hit` (flinch),
  `bullet_passed` (sent only to the peer whose head the bullet passed within 3 m).
- `ImpactEffects` pools: holes, sprays per surface (snow/wood/cloth), smoke, flashes, crack
  sounds. `make_smoke_emitter()` / `make_soft_texture()` are static (Maxim, breath reuse them).
- Footsteps: generated ones were removed (owner: "very bad"). `FootstepSounds` loads real
  recordings by name from `assets/audio/footsteps/` (snow / trench|gravel / wood; trench falls
  back to snow) with `ResourceLoader.list_directory` (works in exports). No files = silent.
  Wind loop is at -14 dB (owner: wind too loud).
- `PlayerFX` (child of Player): footsteps (surface from a ray down: wood meta / trench y < -0.8 /
  snow), breath (child of the camera, local only), drift (top_level, local only, preset
  `drift_amount`). Player `notify_hurt` RPC → `hurt_from` signal → HUD `DamageIndicator`.
- Buses: Master → SFX (Reverb + HardLimiter), Ambience (LowPass used for muffling; volume from
  Settings `ambience_volume`), UI. Made by `tools/make_buses.gd`. Set `bus` on every new player.
- Measured (High, P2): ~165 draw calls (220 max) – fewer than before thanks to one-draw-call
  soldiers – ~275k triangles. Web download ~50 MB.

## Gotchas learned
- **Export bug:** `@export var x: PackedStringArray = []` loses the scene's values when the export
  converts scenes to binary (web build showed hidden Mosin parts, Maxim didn't turn). Use
  `= PackedStringArray()` as the default. Check exports with `tools/check_web_pack.gd`. The
  export also caches converted scenes in `.godot/exported/` – delete it if in doubt.
- **Web bug:** CPUParticles3D colours (`vertex_color_use_as_albedo` + `color`/`color_ramp`) render
  BLACK in WebGL (seen as big black blobs: smoke, breath). `ImpactEffects.web_fallback(p)` turns
  them into a fixed material colour + shrink-away curve when `OS.has_feature("web")`. Every new
  particle effect must call it. (MultiMesh instance colours on the trees are fine.)
- Editor re-imports: the owner's editor switched the imported weapon textures to VRAM compressed +
  mipmaps (normal maps as normal maps). Keep those `.import` files. The Web preset exports only
  desktop formats (`for_mobile=false`), otherwise the textures are stored twice.
- SurfaceTool: `set_skin_weight_count()` must be called BEFORE `begin()`.
- A child's `_ready()` runs before its parent's `@onready` variables are set (PlayerFX can't use
  `player.camera` in `_ready`; use the node path).
- CPUParticles3D `direction` is in the emitter's own space (rotated emitters: use local axes).
- Headless tests run frames very fast (tiny delta): wait with timers, not frame counts, when
  something is smoothed over time.
- A new `class_name` (e.g. `MountedGun`) or new audio files: run `godot --headless --import`
  once before the builder/tests, or scripts using the name fail to parse.
- Compatibility renderer: a MultiMesh with `use_custom_data` but without `use_colors` made
  `COLOR` zero in the shader. Use instance colours instead of custom data.
- Shader files use `//` comments – `##` is a GDScript thing and breaks shader compilation.
- GLSL reserved words (e.g. `patch`) can't be variable names in shaders.
- Headless runs use a dummy renderer: shader errors only show up with a real GL window
  (xvfb + `--rendering-driver opengl3`), e.g. `tools/shots_p1.gd`.
- UI Controls catch mouse events by default: HUD elements must use `mouse_filter = IGNORE`.
  Mouse look is read in `PlayerInput._input()` for that reason.
- CSG subtraction faces take the material of the subtracting shape (trench walls = log material).
- Additive-blend effects are invisible against bright snow; use normal alpha blending.
- Terrain and forest are generated at runtime by `@tool` scripts (not saved in the scene).
- `--script` files compile before autoloads exist, so any script that (indirectly) uses an
  autoload name can't be referenced from them. Tests are therefore plain Nodes started by the
  launcher: `godot --headless --path . --script tools/run.gd -- tools/test_m1.gd`.
  The builder uses `_initialize()` and only `load()`s game scripts at runtime.
- Headless tests must free `Game/PauseMenu` (the mouse can't be captured, so it would pause).
- The navigation map needs a few physics frames after loading before paths are returned.
- After delivering files that change `project.godot` (new autoloads, settings, input actions) or
  add `class_name`s, tell the owner to use **Project → Reload Current Project**: an editor that was
  open keeps the old project settings and shows "Parse error" for scripts using the new names.
- The desktop app may create a `Claude outputs/` folder in the project: it is git-ignored and
  has a `.gdignore`.
- After changing the level geometry, re-bake: select `Navigation` in `levels/test_level.tscn`
  → Bake NavigationMesh (saves `levels/test_level_navmesh.res`).

## Helper tools (`tools/`, not part of the game)
Run with a Godot 4.7.2 binary from the project folder, e.g.
`godot --headless --path . --script tools/test_m3.gd`.
- `setup_project.gd` writes project settings + input map. `build_scenes.gd` generated the
  scenes/materials/weapon & enemy data. **It overwrites scenes** – once the owner edits scenes in the
  editor, edit the .tscn files (or the editor) instead of regenerating, unless he agrees.
- `bake_csg.gd` bakes `levels/source/trench_csg.tscn` into `levels/baked/*.res`; then rebuild the
  level (`build_scenes.gd`) and run `bake_nav.gd`. `make_sounds.py` synthesizes placeholder sounds.
- Run tests through `tools/run.gd` (see above): `test_m1.gd` … `test_m5.gd`,
  `test_benchmark.gd`, `test_mouse.gd` (needs a real window, e.g. xvfb),
  `shots_p1.gd <prefix> [views]` (graphics screenshots, needs xvfb), `test_w1.gd`,
  `shots_w1.gd [prefix]` (weapons + Maxim screenshots), `_model_shots.gd` (renders imported
  models from 4 sides), `import_weapons.py` (unpacks weapon downloads),
  `make_textures.py` (regenerates `assets/textures/`), `test_p2.gd`, `shots_p2.gd` (soldier
  poses, sprays), `shots_battle.gd` (a wave from the trench), `make_buses.gd` (audio buses),
  `check_web_pack.gd` (checks the exported pck, see gotchas),
  `soak_m3.gd`: automated checks. `shots*.gd`: screenshots (need a GL window).
  Run all tests before every commit.
